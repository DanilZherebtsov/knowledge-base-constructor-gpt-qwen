"""SessionStart hook: surfaces overdue project-maintenance items so the model
cannot silently skip the start-of-session freshness check, and re-grounds the
model in project files right after a context compaction.

Reads wiki/log.md (last full `lint` run) and STATE.md (`_Обновлено:` / `_Updated:`),
compares against today, and — ONLY when something is past threshold — emits a
SessionStart `additionalContext` payload instructing the model to raise it in
its first reply, in the user's language. Nothing stale → no output (silent),
matching the "стартовые проверки молчаливы, только при отклонении" rule.

Second job: when `source == "compact"` (the conversation was just replaced by a
summary), always emit a re-grounding note pointing at STATE.md, the open unit of
work and any live `tmp/<run>/` journal. Compaction fires unannounced, usually
mid-work, and drops exactly the operational detail (which item we stopped on,
what was already rejected); PreCompact cannot help — its stdout never reaches
the model — so the recovery happens on the far side of the boundary, here.

Locale-neutral: the injected text is model-facing English (never shown to the
user verbatim); the model translates when it speaks to the human. Identical
byte-for-byte in the RU and EN constructor mirrors.

Always exits 0 — a maintenance hint must never block a session.
